SELECT with JOIN practice:

Join the OrderDetails and Products tables, to show a report where the columns are OrderID, ProductName, and Quantity.
Paste the SQL statement you used below.

SELECT o.OrderID, p.ProductName, o.Quantity FROM Products as p INNER JOIN OrderDetails AS o ON o.ProductID = p.ProductID;

Join the Orders, OrderDetails, and Employees tables to return a report with with the EmployeeName, ProductID, and Quantity.
Paste the SQL statement you used below.  Hint: EmployeeName is not a column in the Employee table, but you can generate a
report with EmployeeName by starting your SQL this way: SELECT (Employees.FirstName || " " || Employees.LastName) AS EmployeeName,

SELECT eo.FirstName || ' ' || eo.LastName AS EmployeeName, od.ProductID, od.Quantity FROM OrderDetails AS od
INNER JOIN
(SELECT e.FirstName, e.LastName, o.OrderID FROM Orders AS o
INNER JOIN
Employees AS e ON e.EmployeeID = o.EmployeeID) AS eo
WHERE eo.OrderID = od.OrderID;
